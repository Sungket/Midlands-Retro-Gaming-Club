My Portfolio front end webpage, made to practice responsive design
This repository has been created by uploading the files I had saved locally, via GitHub website. The webpage I have created is intended as practice for my website design,
and also how I can change things using responsive design. It is intended to be a work in progress, so time permitting I will continue to work on the page
as I gain more knowledge in front end design.
